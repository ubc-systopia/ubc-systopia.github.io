        <P>
Distributed systems are difficult to engineer - they are subject to
subtle communication semantics, complex interleavings, and failure
scenarios that cannot happen within a single system. Tools and
modeling languages, such as PlusCal and TLA+, are available to help
developers and architects give a high-level description of a system,
then perform logic on that system, be that via user-guided formal
proofs or systematic exploration via model checking. A common problem
is that corresponding such models to a practical implementation, a
complex and time-consuming process that can introduce bugs to an
otherwise abstractly correct system, is left up to the developer.

	<p>
PGo compiles PlusCal formal specifications into Go
implementations. PGo is designed to reduce the developer burden of
implementing a correct distributed system specification, and increases
developers' confidence in the correctness of their implementations.
