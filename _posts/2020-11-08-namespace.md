description: "The hierarchical filesystem namespace originated in the 1950s and was modeled after filing cabinets.

        <P>Traditional file systems use a per-silo minimally connected graph, despite the explosive growth in both the size and variety of our storage locations. This work explores potential alternatives by identifying the limitations and the alternatives that have already been explored to find potential new ways to address limitations and enhance our understanding of file system data organization.</P>
