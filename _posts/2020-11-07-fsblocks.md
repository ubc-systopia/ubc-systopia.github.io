        <P>
	Our long term goal is to facilitate synthesis of file systems.
	There are two aspects to this problem: decomposing file sytems into
	primitive components that are amenable to synthesis and then
	developing tools and techniques to assemble working file systems
	from these components.
	</P>
	<p>
	This approach will enable exciting opportunites in file system
	research such as file systems with multiple namesspaces,
	single file systems capable of supporting multiple file
	representations, and much more.
